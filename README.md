first repository
 
Demo repository for intro to git and gethub


notes:
1. do something in file, save to github folder then go to gethub and use commit
2. if you need to undo a commit go to history, right click and say "revert"
3. how to get rid of a file or .DS_store--> right click and select ignore file, changes file to .gitignore file, then commit and git will now not track for that file
4. if you really dont want something tracked remember to ignore right away 
5. branches--> lets you have 2 sets of the same repo stuff, a good way to work on an idea that you may not want to be in the master, or if you want to let someone else play with it without messing with your orginal code 
6. if you have more than one version (aka more than one branch) and you want to merge them back together select choose a branch to merge into master this will add changes in branch to master
